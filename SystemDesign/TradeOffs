#What tradeoffs to discuss during interview
1. Database (SQL vs NoSQL)
2. Blob vs File System
    Query, Indexing, cost. SQL is not specialized for files.
3. Indexing
    Reads become fast but writes become slow as you have to update and sort index on every write.
4. Normalization vs Denormalization
    Normalization makes queries slow as multiple joins are required but saves redundant space.
